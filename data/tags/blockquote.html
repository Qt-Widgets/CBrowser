<h1>Blockquote Test</h1>
<p>We acted incorrectly in arbitrarily changing the Kumquat
Festival date. Quoting from the Kumquat Growers' Bylaws:</p>
<blockquote>
The date of the Kumquat Festival may only be changed by
a two-thirds vote of the General Membership, provided
that a <strong>60 percent quorom</strong> of the Membership
is present.
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine) Since such a quorom was not present, the
vote was invalid.</p>
